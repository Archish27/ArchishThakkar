Rakshak, was designed by keeping in mind, the current disaster management techniques already in place as suggested by the Government. The major feature is the real-time updates coupled with a fast volunteer dispatch system, which will help the organisation/Government to quickly dispatch volunteers to specific disaster affected areas, within a few seconds of the occurrence of the incident.
